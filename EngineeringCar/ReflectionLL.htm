	<h1> Matchbox Replica Reflection </h1>
	<p> Lizzie Lindemeyer </p>
	<p> Engineering and Design Lab Class </p>
	<p> This reflection is about my first 3-D Printing Project where I had to replicate a toy car. </p>

	<h2> Guidlines: </h2>
	<p> The guidelines of this project included creating a replication of a toy car we were given in class. We we're to follow along with the provided tutorial videos for the application OnShape and create a 3-D version of the car on our computer. We were assigned to create a CAD drawing to be able to compare the measurements we made of our car to the 3-D version once the car was printed. Finally we were able to learn how to use the 3-D printer and print out our cars. </p>

	<h2> Process: </h2>
	<p> Throughout the project, the process consisted of using the application OnShape. After taking precise measurements of our car, we uploaded the measurements to OnShape. Through a series of tutorial videos, our measurements quickly became 3-D cars. Eventually we were able to pick a color and print our cars into a 3-D shape using the 3-D printers in the lab. </p>

	<h2> Setback and Solutions: </h2>
	<p> Some setbacks I faced while doing my project included getting used to the application OnShape. I also needed to make sure that my measurements were accurate in order for my car to come out good. Because of these setbacks, my solutions were simple. I had some help from teachers/classmates along with re-watching the tutorial videos. In the end my car came out good and I am happy with my results </p>
